# To-Do-List

## What is it ?

The To-Do-List Project was made to explore to possibilites of basic JavaScript by using DOM, event listeners and local storage.

The website is responsive, has a darkmode option and doesn't use a predefined layout.
With the use of local storage, the todo list is completely functional. We can add, check and delete tasks from the list.

## What did I use ?

- Semantically correct HTML
- SASS / CSS
- JavaScript ( with modules )
